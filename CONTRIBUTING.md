# Contributing to PiVault

First off, thanks for even considering contributing to PiVault. You’re joining a league of extraordinary developers who believe in the power of secure, peer-to-peer storage. Below is everything you need to know to contribute successfully without causing a meltdown (either of the code or your sanity).

## Ground Rules

1. **Code Like a Wizard, Not a Muggle**: Write code that’s as magical as it is logical. No dark magic allowed—keep it clean, readable, and maintainable. Remember, you’re not the only one who’ll have to decipher your spells.

2. **Test Like You Mean It**: If your code doesn’t work, it’s not code—it’s wishful thinking. Write tests that cover all possible scenarios. No shortcuts! If your code doesn’t pass the tests, it’s time to go back to the drawing board (or keyboard).

3. **Pull Requests Are Not Christmas Gifts**: Just because you’ve wrapped up your code in a nice little pull request doesn’t mean it’s ready to be unwrapped. Be ready for feedback, and don’t take it personally. We’re here to make PiVault better, not to roast your code (unless it’s genuinely that bad).

4. **Document Like You’re Writing a Best-Seller**: Your code is awesome, but if no one knows how to use it, what’s the point? Write documentation that’s as entertaining as it is informative. If people laugh and learn at the same time, you’ve nailed it.

5. **Be Respectful, Not a Know-It-All**: We’re all smart here—no need to flex. Respect others' ideas, even if they seem a bit off. Who knows? The next big feature might come from that “silly” idea.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Fork It (But Not Literally)

Click that magical “Fork” button at the top right of this page. This creates your own version of PiVault where you can mess around without breaking anything. It’s like having your own sandbox, but with code.

### Step 2: Clone the Fork (But Beware of Fork Bombs)

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IotA-asce/PiVault.git
```

If you hear weird sounds coming from your machine, you may have cloned a fork bomb instead. In that case, run for cover.

### Step 3: Create a Branch (Not a Tree)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
```

You’re now in a safe space to add your awesome new feature. Try not to break anything that was working fine before.

### Step 4: Commit Like a Pro (No Kitchen Sink Commits)

```bash
git commit -m "Added awesome feature that will change the world"
```

Don’t commit your half-baked ideas. Commit code that’s fully baked and ready to be served hot. And please, for the love of all things good, write meaningful commit messages.

### Step 5: Push and Open a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/awesome-feature
```

Then go back to your repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request. This is where the magic happens—or where your code might get sent back to Hogwarts for more training.

### Step 6: Celebrate or Cry

If your pull request gets merged, celebrate like you just won a Quidditch match. If it doesn’t, cry a little, learn from the feedback, and try again.

### Step 7: Keep Contributing!

PiVault is a living project. The more you contribute, the better it gets. Plus, we promise to make you laugh with every review.

## Code of Conduct

Don’t be a jerk. Simple, right? Treat others with respect, avoid personal attacks, and keep the vibes positive. We’re here to build, not to bicker.
