# PiVault: Your Personal Fort Knox, Powered by Raspberry Pi

Welcome to **PiVault**, where your files are treated like royalty and guarded like the crown jewels. Ever wanted a NAS that’s as secure as it is cool? Look no further. PiVault is your answer to a secure, peer-to-peer, and **totally awesome** storage solution. Plus, it runs on a Raspberry Pi, because why not?

## What is PiVault?

Imagine having a secret vault for all your digital treasures—files, photos, videos—that only you can access. Now imagine that vault being powered by a tiny, mighty Raspberry Pi 5. Add in some magic (read: encryption) and you've got **PiVault**.

But wait, there's more! You don't need to rely on some faceless corporation to store your data. PiVault creates a direct, secure connection between your phone and the Raspberry Pi. It's like having your own private network, minus the creepy tracking.

## Why PiVault? Because Awesomeness, That's Why.

- **Secure AF**: Every storage device you connect is encrypted and tied to a specific user. No one else gets to peek inside.
- **Automagic Syncing**: Your files sync between your phone and PiVault like clockwork. Set it and forget it.
- **Peer-to-Peer Wizardry**: We don’t do middlemen. Your data goes straight from your phone to your PiVault and back. Fast. Private. Awesome.
- **Accessible Everywhere**: Whether you're at home or on the go, PiVault keeps your files within reach—no matter where you are.

## The Hardware: Building Your Vault

You’ll need a few things to turn your Raspberry Pi into the ultimate vault:

- **Raspberry Pi 5**: The brain behind the operation. Handle with care—it’s small, but mighty.
- **External Storage**: SSDs or Hard Disks. The bigger, the better. Remember, more space = more secrets.
- **Network Interface**: Because PiVault likes to stay connected, just like you do.
- **Power Supply & Casing**: You don’t want your vault collapsing, do you?
